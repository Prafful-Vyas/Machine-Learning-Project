# Project Title: Predicting Math Scores using Student Demographics and Academic Performance

## Overview
In this machine learning project, we aim to build a predictive model that estimates math scores for students based on a set of input features. By analyzing student demographics and academic performance, we can provide valuable insights to educators, policymakers, and parents. The project follows an end-to-end pipeline, from data collection and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Dataset
We will use a dataset containing information about students’ math scores along with the following features:

Gender: Binary (Male/Female)
Ethnicity: Categorical (e.g., Asian, African American, Hispanic, etc.)
Parental Level of Education: Categorical (e.g., High School, Bachelor’s Degree, Master’s Degree, etc.)
Test Preparation Course: Binary (Yes/No)
Reading Score: Continuous (scaled score)
Writing Score: Continuous (scaled score)

## Steps in the Project

1. Data Collection
Obtain a well-structured dataset with the necessary features. You can explore educational databases or use publicly available datasets.

2. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the data.
Encode categorical features (e.g., one-hot encoding for ethnicity).
Normalize or standardize numerical features (e.g., reading and writing scores).

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize the distribution of math scores across different features.
Identify correlations between features and the target variable (math score).

4. Feature Engineering
Create additional relevant features if needed (e.g., combining parental education levels). Select important features using techniques like feature importance or correlation analysis.

5. Model Selection
Choose appropriate regression models (e.g., linear regression, decision tree, or ensemble methods). Split the dataset into training and validation sets.

6. Model Training
Train the selected models using the training data. Optimize hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation.

7. Model Evaluation
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Compare different models and select the best-performing one.

11. Interpretability
Interpret feature importance to understand which factors influence math scores the most. Provide actionable insights for educators and parents.
Deliverables. A well-documented Jupyter notebook or Python script detailing the entire process. Visualizations, model performance metrics, and insights.Recommendations for improving student outcomes based on the model’s predictions.

This project aims to empower educational stakeholders with data-driven insights to enhance student performance.
